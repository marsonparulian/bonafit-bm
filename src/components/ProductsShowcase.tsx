                Vaname crustaceans, also known as
                <em>Litopenaeus vannamei</em> or whiteleg shrimp, are one of the
                most popular types of farmed shrimp worldwide. They are
                sometimes referred to as
                <em>Pacific white shrimp</em> or
                <em>king prawn</em>

              <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                People like Vaname shrimp because of their mild flavor, firm
                texture, and versatility in many dishes, from grilled skewers to
                stir-fries. They are also fast-growing and relatively easy to
                farm, making them more affordable and widely available compared
                to other shrimp species. In addition, their pale color and
                consistent size make them visually appealing for both home cooks
                and professional chefs. Their popularity continues to rise as
                demand for sustainable and protein-rich seafood options grows.
