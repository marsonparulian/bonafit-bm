                  Vaname crustaceans, also known as{" "}
                  <strong>Litopenaeus vannamei</strong> or whiteleg shrimp, are
                  one of the most popular types of farmed shrimp worldwide. They
                  are sometimes referred to as{" "}
                  <strong>Pacific white shrimp</strong> or
                  <strong>king prawn</strong>
                  in various markets.
                </p>

                <p>
                  People like Vaname shrimp because of their mild flavor, firm
                  texture, and versatility in many dishes, from grilled skewers
                  to stir-fries. They are also fast-growing and relatively easy
                  to farm, making them more affordable and widely available
                  compared to other shrimp species. In addition, their pale
                  color and consistent size make them visually appealing for
                  both home cooks and professional chefs. Their popularity
                  continues to rise as demand for sustainable and protein-rich
                  seafood options grows.
